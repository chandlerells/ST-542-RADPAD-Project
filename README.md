This just has some notes regarding the files: 

1 - I tried to standardize the naming conventions of the variables. 

2 - I did not know if we wanted to give numeric coding to the different types of missing data ( I did, but the different types of missing data might not be structured enough to have standard codes, so we might 
just change missing values to zero). 

3 - In this preliminary data, we only have 5 personnel out of the 7, so I assume the other two will be given in the final data.

4 - In one of the files, theere was a BVP and BPV procedure type. They might be the same, but I did not change them just in case. 

5 - We might want to have exploratory data analysis for control and experimental group combined, and then broken out - I started with just observing the control group. 

6 - This is a bit ahead of the curve, but for our two sample t - test , we will probably need to conisider whether or not we plan to pool the variances of the control and the treatment groups. 
We might need to add a diagnostic test for it to see if the standard deviations between the control and the treatment groups are close enough or not to pool.

7 - I don't know if this might be needed, but we might want to do boostrap sampling to see if our sampling distribution is (approximately) normal, and thus, we could use the t - distribuiton for our hypothesis
test. I don't know if we would need to show this in the report or not, but just an idea - again, very ahead of the curve.
